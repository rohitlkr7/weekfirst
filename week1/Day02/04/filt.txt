âœ… Key Fixes Explained:
Problem	Fix Applied
Overlapping .box elements due to position: absolute and negative margins	Removed position: absolute, used display: flex with gap to space boxes properly
box-sizing not set	Added box-sizing: border-box globally to ensure padding/border doesn't affect dimensions
.text positioning awkward (stuck at left 50%, top 0)	Centered horizontally using transform: translateX(-50%), added padding and background
Responsiveness missing	Used flex-wrap: wrap so boxes wrap on smaller screens
Visual clarity	Added spacing and better layout structure using margin, padding, and colors

ðŸ§ª Final Result:
Three boxes aligned side-by-side with spacing and wrapping on small screens.

A fixed message bar (.text) neatly centered at the top.

Clean, modern layout without overlapping elements.
